# AoC
This repository conatains my solution for the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
For each year it contains code till the point I got too lazy (2022 is gonna be different! /s).
## 2020 (18 days)
- Haskell (day 1 and 2) 
  - Don't look, it's ugly.
- Java (day 1 till 18)
  - Mainly practiced with [Streams](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html).
## 2021 (14 days)
- JavaScript (day 1 till 3)
  - I wasn't ready.
- Scala (day 4 till 12)
  - Scala is a nice blend of functional and imperative style programming.
- C++ (day 13 and 14)
  - It ain't much but it's honest work.
## 2022
- Either Scala or C++...
